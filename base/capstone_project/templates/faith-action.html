            <p>Faith 'n Action is a blockchain-driven web application designed to modernize the Knights of Columbus (KoFC) Lucena Chapter by enhancing transparency, engagement, and efficiency in donation and community service. This platform serves as a centralized hub for members, officers, and the public, offering secure donation tracking via blockchain, real-time activity monitoring, and streamlined event management. Key features include a transparent donation portal (with immutable ledger records), automated member tier systems, QR-based attendance tracking, and humanitarian and request tools. By digitizing operations, the app ensures accountability in fundraising, simplifies volunteer coordination, and preserves the council's legacy through a digital historical archive. Ultimately, Faith 'n Action empowers the KoFC Lucena to strengthen trust with donors, boost member participation, and amplify their impact in serving faith and communityâ€”all while upholding the order's core values of charity, unity, and fraternity.</p>
